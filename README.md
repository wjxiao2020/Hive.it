# Hive.it Inventory Management System üçØ

## Highlight Features
### Smooth Real-Time Update
Hive.it provides different ways to manage the item counts, aiming for an easy breeze for all use cases:
1. quick add/reduce/delete shortcut action buttons following each item entry 
2. a form to update existing items or add new items by several instances at a time. No need to tire your finger to press shortcut buttons multiple times!

There is always a way that suits you the best, and the updates will show up immediately without the need to refresh the page!

### Easy Search
Type some letters and press Enter! Now you can see all items with names containing what you have typed! You don't have to worry about upper-lower-case mess. I got you covered ;)

### See the Items
Take a picture directly on Hive.it or upload a photo you already have of an item. When you hover over the table row showing that item's information, you will see its photo popping up as well!

### Neat Naming and Ordering
The first letter in an item name is automatically capitalized and the table is in the alphabetical order! Looking so neat and it's so easy to find what you are looking for!
